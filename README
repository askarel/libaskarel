libaskarel.sh - a bash library

This library contains a bunch of functions that i'm too lazy to copy/paste into my scripts.
Those functions are going to make your life easier as a bash programmer.

At the moment, it looks very stupid, but it will grow to support bigger applications,
and i will move my code from several unrelated applications to it.
